# QUDUE DESKTOP APPLICATION

A runnable version of the application is provided by the QuDueApp.jar file.

Before attempting to run the program please ensure that the current system has either JRE (Java Runtime Environment or JDK (Java Development Kit) pre-installed. Information on how to do so can be found here : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html.

Also be aware that the application needs a strong internet connection to run successfully and that any firewall is not blocking the applicationâ€™s processes .

If the operating system is OS X (Mac) then the file should run automatically on a double-click.

If the operating system is Windows and the double-click function does not work than the file can be executed by entering the following line in the Command Prompt: 
java -jar file-path/QuDue.jar
